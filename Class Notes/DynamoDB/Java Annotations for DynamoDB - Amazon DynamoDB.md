## @DynamoDbBean

When the `@DynamoDbBean` annotation is provided, it marks a class as a DynamoDB-enhanced client object that can be mapped to a DynamoDB table. This annotation enables the use of the DynamoDB Enhanced Client API to serialize and deserialize instances of the annotated class to and from DynamoDB items.
#### Key Ideas:

- `@DynamoDbBean` is part of the AWS SDK DynamoDB Enhanced Client library.
- It indicates that the class is a Java bean compatible with DynamoDB.
- The class must have getter and setter methods for all fields to allow the Enhanced Client to handle the mapping.
- This annotation works in conjunction with other annotations like `@DynamoDbPartitionKey`, `@DynamoDbSortKey`, and `@DynamoDbAttribute` to map specific fields to table attributes.
- It simplifies the implementation of DynamoDB CRUD operations by abstracting serialization details.
## @DynamoDbPartitionKey

The `@DynamoDbPartitionKey` annotation is used to specify that the `getDelegationId` method represents the partition key for a DynamoDB table. The partition key is a fundamental component of DynamoDB's schema design and is used to uniquely identify and retrieve items within the table.
### Key Ideas

- The `@DynamoDbPartitionKey` annotation maps the returned value of the `getDelegationId` method to the partition key of a DynamoDB table.
- The `getDelegationId` method retrieves the value of the `delegationId` field, which acts as the unique identifier for items in the DynamoDB table.
- The method is a standard Java getter method, following the JavaBeans convention.
- This annotation is part of the AWS SDK for Java, specifically used for integration with DynamoDB.
- The presence of this annotation indicates that `delegationId` is critical for item storage and retrieval in the DynamoDB table.

The `getDelegationId` method in the `Car` class (defined in `rentingCar/src/main/java/dev/renting/delegations/Car.java` at lines 19-22) is annotated with `@DynamoDbPartitionKey`. This means the value returned by this method (the `delegationId` field) is used as the partition key when interacting with the DynamoDB table. The method itself is a simple getter that returns the value of the `delegationId` field.
## @DynamoDbSortKey

The annotation `@DynamoDbSortKey` indicates that the `getOperation` method is associated with the sort key in an Amazon DynamoDB table. This specifies that the `operation` field in the `Car` class is used as the sort key for the table, which helps organize and query data effectively.
#### Key Ideas:

- The `@DynamoDbSortKey` annotation is part of the AWS SDK for Java.
- It marks the `operation` field as the sort key for a DynamoDB table.
- The sort key allows for sorting and filtering items with the same partition key.
- The method `getOperation` is a getter for the `operation` field in the `Car` class.
- This is likely used in conjunction with a partition key to uniquely identify or query items in the DynamoDB table.

Within its context, the `@DynamoDbSortKey` annotation is applied to the `getOperation` method, which returns the value of the `operation` field. This ensures that when the `Car` object is persisted or queried in DynamoDB, the `operation` field is recognized as the sort key.

## @DynamoDbAttribute

The `@DynamoDbAttribute` annotation to map a field in a Java class to an attribute in an Amazon DynamoDB table.

- **Annotation Purpose**: `@DynamoDbAttribute("make")` specifies that the `make` property in the `Car` class corresponds to the `"make"` attribute in the DynamoDB table.
- **Getter Method**: The `getMake()` method retrieves the value of the `make` field from the `Car` object.
- **Integration with DynamoDB**: This annotation is part of the AWS SDK for DynamoDB, allowing the `Car` class to interact with a DynamoDB table seamlessly.
- **Data Mapping**: It ensures that when the `Car` object is read from or written to DynamoDB, the `make` attribute is correctly serialized/deserialized.
- **Encapsulation**: The use of a getter method (`getMake`) follows Java's encapsulation principle, exposing the `make` field indirectly.

In the `Car.java` file, the code snippet is part of the `getMake()` method, which provides a way to retrieve the value of the `make` field from an instance of the `Car` class. The `@DynamoDbAttribute("make")` annotation is used to bind the `make` field to the `"make"` column in a DynamoDB table for proper database interactions.
