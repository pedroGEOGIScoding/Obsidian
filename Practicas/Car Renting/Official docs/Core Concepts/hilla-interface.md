# Interface

## Intro & Lins

From [to-do app **walking skeleton**](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/getting-started/start)

> TypeScript type generated by Vaadin Hilla: designed to let the frontend (for example, a `.tsx` React component) work safely and easily with data coming from the Java backend. 

## What the Interface Represents

This TypeScript interface describes a *Task* object, which is likely defined as a Java class or record on your backend. Hilla automatically generates this interface so the frontend code knows exactly what properties a Task has, and what types they are[5](https://albertprofe.dev/springboot/boot-concepts-vaadin-hilla.html)[7](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/building-apps/business-logic/add-service/hilla)[6](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/hilla/lit/guides/endpoints).

```typescript
import type AbstractEntity_1 from "../../base/domain/AbstractEntity.js";

interface Task extends AbstractEntity_1 {
    id?: number;
    description: string;
    creationDate: string;
    dueDate?: string;
}
export default Task;
```

Explanation of Task interface:

**1. `import type AbstractEntity_1 ...`**

- This line imports another interface or type, probably representing some base entity fields (like `createdBy`, `updatedAt`, etc.) that are common to many entities in your app.

- `Task` will inherit all properties from `AbstractEntity_1`.

**2. `interface Task extends AbstractEntity_1`**

- This declares a new interface called `Task` that extends (inherits from) `AbstractEntity_1`.

- This means `Task` will have all the properties of `AbstractEntity_1`, plus the ones defined here.

**3. Properties of `Task`**

- `id?: number;`  
  The `id` is optional (`?`), and is a number. It might not always be present (for example, before the task is saved).

- `description: string;`  
  The description is required and must be a string.

- `creationDate: string;`  
  The creation date is required and must be a string (usually an ISO date string).

- `dueDate?: string;`  
  The due date is optional and is also a string (again, likely an ISO date string).

**4. `export default Task;`**

- This makes the `Task` interface available for import in other files, such as your React or Lit components.

Why and How This is Used in Hilla:

- **Automatic Generation:**  
  Hilla analyzes your Java backend (classes/records annotated for Hilla endpoints) and generates matching TypeScript interfaces for the frontend[6](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/hilla/lit/guides/endpoints)[7](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/building-apps/business-logic/add-service/hilla)[5](https://albertprofe.dev/springboot/boot-concepts-vaadin-hilla.html).

- **Type Safety:**  
  This ensures your frontend code knows exactly what data to expect from the backend, reducing bugs and improving developer experience[5](https://albertprofe.dev/springboot/boot-concepts-vaadin-hilla.html)[7](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/building-apps/business-logic/add-service/hilla).

- **Usage in Components:**  
  You can import and use this interface in your `.tsx` (React) or Lit components to type-check your data, props, or state. For example:
  
  ```typescript
  import Task from 'Frontend/generated/path/to/Task';
  
  const MyComponent = (props: { task: Task }) => (
    <div>
      <h3>{props.task.description}</h3>
      <p>Created: {props.task.creationDate}</p>
      {props.task.dueDate && <p>Due: {props.task.dueDate}</p>}
    </div>
  );
  ```

Summary Table

| Property     | Type   | Required? | Description               |
| ------------ | ------ | --------- | ------------------------- |
| id           | number | No        | Task identifier           |
| description  | string | Yes       | Task details              |
| creationDate | string | Yes       | When the task was created |
| dueDate      | string | No        | When the task is due      |

- This interface is a TypeScript version of your Java Task entity, generated by Hilla for frontend use.

- It makes sure your frontend knows exactly what fields a Task has, and what types they are, for safe and easy coding in your components[6](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/hilla/lit/guides/endpoints)[7](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/building-apps/business-logic/add-service/hilla)[5](https://albertprofe.dev/springboot/boot-concepts-vaadin-hilla.html).
